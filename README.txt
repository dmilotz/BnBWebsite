Design and prototyping of mashup project
You will use the evolutionary process model to design and implement a mashup website prototype in this milestone. The key requirements in this milestone are as follows.

A. Implementation of selected features
Implement six or more main features in accordance with the use cases from Milestone 1. You can download all the features under this milestone from featurelist.zip. Demonstrate with your feature prototype in class and include some snapshot of the main steps in your ppt. and report. You should correct the milestone 1 part A design per validation result in milestone 1 part B before attempting to implement your prototype features

B. Object Oriented design
1) Create the class diagrams for your implemented features as well as the overall system with an open source software.
2) Use UML notation for this purpose and export your class diagrams to a separate file.
3) Indicate in your report what open source software did you use to create the class diagrams.
4) Show clearly the association, inheritance, and other relationships on your class diagrams
C. Software development, versioning, and testing
1) Document in your report how you use Eclipse to develop your software by including few snapshots
2) Show how you use the Github.com to manage the version control of your software and include snapshots to show the process.
D. Host your work under instructor’s server
1) Install and configure web and database servers for testing your prototype software locally
2) Upload your working features to web server provided by the instructor and provide either a simple webpage flow to show all the features or a starting webpage that contains links to all your prototype features.
E. Report should contain at least the following 
1) Software platform and/or library used to implement your prototype. Include weblinks to any software used and a brief configuration  summary if available.
2) How all your prototypes can be connected in the next milestone. 
3) Indicate any open risk or gaps with your current approach.
